//! A "self-initializing" vector. This data structure offers
//! O(1) indexing and O(1) initialization: an element is
//! lazily initialized upon first reference as needed.
//!
//! # Theory of Operation
//!
//! The implementation uses a large index vector of
//! initially uninitialized memory, together with a stack of
//! stored values. As such, it will occupy space
//! proportional to its capacity, and additional space
//! proportional to the number of stored elements.
//!
//! The basic strategy of this data structure is to keep an
//! initially-uninitialized index vector and a stack of
//! allocated values.  A given index has a valid value if
//! its index vector points into the stack and the stack
//! element it points to shows the same index. Otherwise,
//! the data structure can be adjusted to make this true,
//! creating a default value as needed.
//!
//! ## Data Structure
//! 
//! * We have a stack, which is initially empty.
//! 
//! * Every entry on the stack points to a specific cell in
//!   the array.
//! 
//! * Every initialized entry in the array points back to
//! its corresponding entry on the stack. (The uninitialized
//! entries, obviously, could point anywhere, including onto
//! the stack.)
//! 
//! ## To read from the array:
//! 
//! * Look up the array entry. See if it points back into
//! the stack. If so, *check that the stack entry points to
//! that array entry.*
//! 
//!    * If both pointers are valid and match, the array
//!    element has been previously initialized, so its
//!    contents are valid. In this case, finish the
//!    read. (The value can be stored either on the stack
//!    or in the array: the stack is a better idea, since
//!    the array uses vast amounts of VM and the stack will
//!    be limited-size.)
//!  
//!    * If the array pointer is invalid or the stack
//!    pointer doesn't match it, the array element is
//!    uninitialized. Throw an error. (Alternatively,
//!    initialize as below with some default value and
//!    return that.)
//! 
//! ## To write to the array:
//! 
//! * Do the same check as the read. If the check passes, overwrite the value.
//! 
//! * If the check fails, push a new entry on the stack,
//! adjust the stack entry and the array entry to point to
//! each other, and write the value.
//! 
//! ## Efficiency
//! 
//! Note that every operation is constant-time and consumes
//! constant space. (We will agree to ignore the giant pile
//! of uninitialized virtual memory lying in the corner.)
//! Thus, our efficiency is as good (in some sense) as a
//! normal array write. But *we don't have to initialize the
//! giant array first,* which is great if the array is going
//! to be really sparsely filled.
